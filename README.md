# Customer-Analytics-Olist-Ecommerce

Customer Analytics is defined as the process that companies use to capture and analysecustomer data for business decisions.

The aim of this notebook is to analyse the Olist dataset, available on Kaggle, to proivide actionable insights on customer behaviour and value.

### Olist Business Model

The customers could be divided in two large buckets:

- **Direct cutomers**, who are the stores tha use Olist to connect to their customers. 
- **Indirect customers**, who are the customers of the stores.

The direct customers generate revenue by paying a fee to use Olist services. Olist collected an extensive amount of data about indirect customers, which can be used to provide better services to the direct customers by offering the insight on their customers.

This project is divided in six notebooks, each one addressing a specific issue.

#### Analysis of direct customers:
- Customer Acquisition - Marketing funnel and conversion rate analysis
- Closed deals analysis

#### Analysis of indirect customers:
- Customer Retention
- Customer Engagement
- Customer Satisfaction
- Revenue analysis
- Customer Lifetime Value
